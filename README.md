# Project X Roblox Executor
**Read Before you do anything**
This is my Roblox Lua Executor, which I actually stopped in 2023 after 2 years of development and made open source. In the meantime, I have received some support and am starting to work on the project again. On February 17, 2025, the first update came out, which makes the executor fully functional again. Further updates will come in the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, due to legal and security reasons, I had to remove large parts of the old source code from the GitHub repo. The executor is currently being developed as a closed source project.
**Why iI Leaked everything/make it Open-Source?**
The reason is simple, Roblox is now working with SynapseX, which makes developing Roblox cheats
much more complicated and I now want to stop creating Roblox cheats because the work for a free and
ab-free executer is simply no longer worth it

**WARNING FOR DANGEROUS FAKE UPLOADS!**
I would like to issue another urgent warning about possible fake repos and releases. Even after Project X was actually discontinued, I saw that many people released old versions of the executor and infected them with malware such as stealers and RATs. Please make sure that the official uploads of Project X are ONLY published on my discord (link below), cheater.fun, or in this repo.

This is the Official Repo of Project X, WeepingAngel is my main name, Crafttino21 my old one.
