# Project X Roblox Executor | discontinued

### Project X got discontinued!
**Discord statment by Owner**
```
"As you all know, Project X has been offline for quite some time. This was due to several reasons.
Among other things, the regular updates and improvements to Byfron made things considerably more difficult for me.
Therefore, I've decided to discontinue Project X.
However, there's good news: A successor to Project X,
called voidclient, is coming soon. This is a new project with a fresh, new development team and tons of new features.
It will be the complete opposite of Project X—this time better, more beautiful, and more powerful—and it will have significantly less downtime.
The Discord server will be rebranded in the future, and more and more new information will be announced here leading up to the release.
So, if you're still interested, stay tuned; something amazing is coming.
For now, Merry Christmas, if you celebrate it, and have a great evening. I'm happy to have anyone who stays

**WARNING FOR DANGEROUS FAKE UPLOADS!**
- I would like to issue another urgent warning about possible fake repos and releases. Even after Project X was actually discontinued, I saw that many people released old versions of the executor and infected them with malware such as stealers and RATs. Please make sure that the official uploads of Project X are ONLY published on my discord (link below), cheater.fun, or in this repo.
